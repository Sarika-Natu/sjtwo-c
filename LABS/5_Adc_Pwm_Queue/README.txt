SID:014529138
LAB5-ADC_PWM

Part0 is commented. Part1, Part2 and Part3 are extended.

The lab provides communication between ADC driver and PWM driver using queues.

Extra functionality: Integrated multi color LEDS circuit with 4 PWM channels.
PWM frequency is set to 1HZ and duty cycle is controlled by Potentiometer using ADC driver.

PWM channels : PWM0, PWM1, PWM2, PWM4
ADC channel: ADC2
